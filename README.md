# Credits

This resource is an overhaul of the esx_sell resource by ExoticNx, esx_npcdrugsells by x0Z3ro0x, and the base esx_drugs resource by ESX-org. This is a rewrite of the 3 to blend them into a single resource in an attempt to simplify things and consolidate. Also in a hope to make things much easier to maintain and adjust on server admins at a future time.
